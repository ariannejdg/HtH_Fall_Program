Recently, I've been interested in the new shows and movies that have come out on Netflix because I'm an avid Netflix watcher. This dataset hasn't been updated in a while, but I think it would still be useful in finding what kinds of media have been released as of 2021. The questons I would like to have answered through the analysis this dataset:
1. What type of media has Netflix focused on releasing/adding more: movies or shows?
2. What are the most prominent ratings?
3. Does Netflix concentrate their content towards more recently produced media (2000s to present)?
4. What genres are most prominent on Netflix?
5. What lengths of shows are most prominent on Netflix?
6. Does Netflix add more shows or movies that are produced from a certain country?
7. What release year is most prominent on Netflix?
8. Which actors starred the most on Netflix?
9. Which year had the most hours worth of movies added onto Netflix?
10. Who is the most prominent director on Netflix?
