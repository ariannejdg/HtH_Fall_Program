Recently, I've been interested in the new shows and movies that have come out on Netflix because I'm an avid Netflix watcher. This dataset hasn't been updated in a while, but I think it would still be useful in finding what kinds of media have been released as of 2021. The questons I would like to have answered through the analysis this dataset:
1. What type of media has Netflix focused on releasing/adding more: movies or shows?
2. What ratings does Netflix add the most?
3. Does Netflix concentrate their content towards more recently produced media (2000s to present)?
4. What genres are most prominent on Netflix?
