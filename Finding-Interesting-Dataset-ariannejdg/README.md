As I browsed on Kaggle for a better dataset than my previous one, I stumbled upon this dataset about expenses in the Philippines, which is where my family is from. I thought it would be intriguing and interesting to figure out the different relationships various factors have on how much one spends, both before and during the pandemic, through data analysis.

These are the questions I would like to answer through my analysis:
1. What is the range between the average expenses made before and during the pandemic?
2. Who spent the most during the pandemic: men or women?
3. Which region spent the least during the pandemic?
4. Which occupation spent the most before the pandemic?
5. Which occupation spent the most during the pandemic?
6. What is the relationship between age, transportation expenses, and expenses before the pandemic?
7. What preferred setup spent the most during the pandemic?
8. What is the relationship between transportation expenses, travel time, and expenses during the pandemic?
9. Which occupation spends the most time travelling?
10. Make a prediction on the expenses made during the pandemic based on one's age.
